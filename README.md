# Uconn Intel/IBACs AI Workshop
This is the repo that will be used to store the code used 
for the Intel / IBACs AI technical workshop hosted at 
the University of Connecticut.

In order to run the scripts in this directory, you will 
need python 3.6 and several packages.
Required packages:
+ TensorFlow
+ PIL (via Pillow)

Through downloading and installing TensorFlow you will download 
the other packages not listed.

In order to install TensorFlow, please refer to the official installation
instructions located [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).
I highly recommend following the installation instructions that create
a virtual environment in the *~/tensorflow* folder. If you are on a laptop,
you will most likely want to install the *cpu* version of TensorFlow.

In order to install PIL, first activate the TensorFlow virtual environment.
Then, run *pip install Pillow* in your terminal.


The scripts located in this directory have been tested with Python 3.6
